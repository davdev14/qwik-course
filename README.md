IMPORTANT: please use Node 18 (Long-term support version) to take this course.

# Instructions for taking this course

If you want, you can install the course code and code along as you go through the course. 

Notice that this is optional, the course will still make perfect sense if you choose to just watch it and not code along as you go.

But coding along is one of the best ways to learn, so I encourage you to try it out.  

This section teaches you how to get your local development environment up and running, so that you can comfortably learn the framework in a stable environment.

This repository provides you with a playground environment with everything you need, including a backend server that you will use during the course.

This repository contains a few branches:

- the 1-start branch is the starting point of the course

- the main branch contains the finished version of the code. You should refer to this branch in case of doubts with any of the imports, and to compare your code with the finished code.

# How To install the course code
